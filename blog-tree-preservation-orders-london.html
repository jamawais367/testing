    <p class="lead">Understanding TPOs and how they affect tree work across the capital.</p>

    <article>
      <h2>What is a Tree Preservation Order?</h2>
      <p>A Tree Preservation Order (TPO) is a legal instrument used by local planning authorities to protect specific trees, groups of trees or woodlands. In London, many mature or significant trees are covered by TPOs or lie within conservation areas where additional protections apply. Felling or carrying out work on trees protected by a TPO without the council’s written consent is a criminal offence and can lead to enforcement action, fines, and requirements to replace the tree.</p>

      <h2>How do TPOs affect property owners?</h2>
      <p>If a tree on your property is subject to a TPO you must get consent from the local authority before undertaking removal, topping or significant pruning. There are exceptions for immediate safety: if a tree poses an imminent risk to life or property, emergency works may be authorised on safety grounds, but councils should be notified as soon as possible. Owners should always check the local authority’s online mapping and contact planning officers before instructing work.</p>

      <h2>Applying for consent</h2>
      <p>Applications to work on protected trees are made to the local council and usually require a tree survey, justification for the proposed works, and sometimes support from a qualified arboriculturalist. The council will assess the impact on amenity and the health of the tree. In some cases, conditions are applied, such as replacement planting or timing restrictions to protect nesting birds under wildlife legislation.</p>

      <h2>How we help</h2>
      <p>We advise clients on TPO checks, prepare applications and, where necessary, submit technical evidence such as decay assessments or structural reports. For urgent hazardous trees we can help obtain emergency authorisations and provide supporting documentation to the council. Working with experienced arborists reduces delays and ensures compliance with local planning rules.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Before removing or undertaking significant work on trees in London, always check for TPOs or conservation area rules. If in doubt, contact your local council or an arboriculture professional. We offer guidance and practical support to navigate permissions and carry out work responsibly and legally.</p>
