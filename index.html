						<h3>Emergency Tree Removal</h3>
						<p class="service-excerpt">Immediate, safe removal of fallen or hazardous trees. Available 24/7.</p>
						<div class="service-body">
							<p>When a tree becomes an immediate danger to people, property or access, fast professional action is required. Our Emergency Tree Removal service covers urgent situations across London where fallen or damaged trees pose an immediate risk. We prioritise safety and rapid response: our teams are equipped with the right tools, insurance and expertise to contain hazards and clear obstructed roads, gardens or driveways quickly and efficiently.</p>

							<p>Each emergency call begins with a swift risk assessment from a qualified arborist who determines the safest, most efficient removal plan. This includes evaluating structural damage to the tree, the potential for further movement, and the proximity to buildings, power lines, or pedestrians. Our crews use proper bracing, rigging, and sectional dismantling techniques to prevent secondary damage. If access is restricted, we implement careful staging and may deploy cranes or specialist lifting equipment when required. We also coordinate with local authorities when road closures or public safety measures are needed.</p>

							<p>Our Emergency Tree Removal service is designed to minimise disruption while protecting property and people. We offer quick mobilization (often within a few hours for urgent cases in central London), transparent pricing with emergency call-out fees explained upfront, and full cleanup and disposal of debris. Because emergency removals can be complex, we ensure every job is covered by our public liability insurance and follows UK health and safety standards. After removal, we can provide recommendations for replacement planting or long-term tree management to reduce future risk.</p>

							<p>Choosing London Tree Removal Experts for emergencies means you get experienced arborists who understand London's urban environment. Our teams have repeatedly worked in tight gardens, heritage areas, and disputed boundary situations, providing a calm, regulated response when time is critical. Call our 24/7 line and we’ll assess the situation, provide a quote, and mobilise the right team to make the site safe.</p>

						<h3>Large Tree Removal</h3>
						<p class="service-excerpt">Specialist removal for large and mature trees, safely and precisely.</p>
						<div class="service-body">
							<p>Large tree removal demands careful planning, specialist equipment and experienced crews to ensure a safe outcome. Whether you have a mature tree whose roots are compromising structures, a specimen that presents a future risk, or a tree requiring removal for redevelopment, our Large Tree Removal service is tailored for high-skill operations across London’s varied urban landscapes.</p>

							<p>We begin with a comprehensive site survey and risk assessment performed by a qualified arboriculturalist. The assessment covers the tree’s species and condition, access routes, proximity to buildings and services, root plate stability, and the presence of protected features such as Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) or conservation-area considerations. Based on that survey we prepare a method statement describing the step-by-step dismantling approach: sectional dismantling from the crown down, use of ropes and rigging, and where necessary, crane-assisted removal to avoid damage to property or obstructed streets.</p>

							<p>Our crews use modern chainsaws, winches, chippers and telehandlers to break the removal into controlled phases. For very large trunks we will plan the sequence of cuts and secure lowering lines to ensure every limb and section is lowered safely to the ground. Stump treatment and grinding are available following the removal to completely clear the site for landscaping or construction. Waste is managed in accordance with UK regulations and recycled where possible, and we provide a full, itemised invoice for transparency.</p>

							<p>Clients who choose our Large Tree Removal service are often dealing with complicated logistics: tight London gardens, nearby listed buildings, or restricted street access. Our experience spans working with local councils, utility companies and construction teams so that larger removal projects are handled smoothly and to schedule. If required, we can assist with temporary traffic management and liaise with neighbours or local authorities to coordinate safe access and removal windows.</p>

						<h3>Dangerous Tree Removal</h3>
						<p class="service-excerpt">Removal of diseased, unstable or storm-damaged trees to protect people and property.</p>
						<div class="service-body">
							<p>Trees weakened by disease, pest infestation, root failure or storm damage can become a serious hazard. Our Dangerous Tree Removal service focuses on identifying and mitigating these high-risk trees before they cause injury or damage. With years of arboriculture experience across London, our team is trained to detect signs of decay, structural weakness and progressive failure that are not always obvious to the untrained eye.</p>

							<p>The process starts with a thorough assessment: we inspect for fungal fruiting bodies, internal decay, cracks or wounds in the trunk, root plate undermining, crown dieback, or evidence of pest activity. For trees affected by advanced decay or structural defects we provide a clear remediation plan which may include bracing and pruning where appropriate, or full removal when the risk cannot be reduced safely. For trees in complex positions near houses, conservations or high-footfall areas, we often use sectional dismantling and a coordinated team to secure each piece before lowering it down.</p>

							<p>Our priority is to protect people and buildings while preserving trees wherever safe to do so. When removal is required, we use controlled dismantling and specialised rigging to avoid collateral damage. We can also carry out emergency shoring or temporary fencing to make the site safe during the operation. If a tree is subject to a Tree Preservation Order, we provide advice on the legal process and work with clients to obtain necessary permissions or emergency exemptions where applicable.</p>

							<p>Choosing a proactive, experienced team for dangerous tree situations reduces long-term liability and prevents costly, sudden incidents. Our Dangerous Tree Removal service includes post-job reporting, photographs and suggested follow-up actions like stump grinding, replacement planting, or ongoing monitoring plans to keep your property safe over time.</p>

					<article class="service-card" id="stump-grinding">
						<h3>Stump Grinding</h3>
						<p class="service-excerpt">Efficient stump removal to restore space and prevent regrowth.</p>
						<div class="service-body">
							<p>After a tree has been felled or removed, an unsightly and obstructive stump can remain. Our Stump Grinding service eliminates the stump efficiently, restoring the usability and appearance of gardens, paving and driveways while reducing the risk of rot, pests or re-sprouting. We use powerful stump grinders capable of handling small garden stumps up to large root plates, ensuring the surface can be backfilled or landscaped as required.</p>

							<p>Stump grinding involves chipping the stump and significant portion of the roots to below ground level (typically 8–12 inches), leaving a cavity that can be filled with topsoil and seeded or paved over. This method is much less invasive than full excavation and reduces damage to surrounding surfaces. Before grinding, we check for underground services and, where necessary, use less aggressive techniques to protect nearby utilities. For stumps in tight or sensitive locations we apply handheld grinding tools to control dust, vibration and impact.</p>

							<p>We also offer optional follow-up services such as roots removal, backfilling, soil conditioning and replanting. Our crews manage the woodchip by offering it to the customer for mulch or taking it away for recycling. Health and safety is central: teams wear protective equipment and use dust suppression measures where appropriate. Since stump grinding can affect soil composition, we advise on restoration steps to prepare the site for new planting or hardscaping.</p>

							<p>Stump removal is an important step for property improvement, pest prevention and long-term landscape planning. We provide honest, transparent pricing, explain any access or surface protection needs, and schedule work to minimise disruption to your daily life in London. For commercial or large-scale jobs we coordinate logistics to clear multiple stumps efficiently across a site.</p>

						<h3>Tree Cutting & Disposal</h3>
						<p class="service-excerpt">Pruning, crown reduction and responsible disposal of tree waste.</p>
						<div class="service-body">
							<p>Proper cutting and pruning maintains tree health, reduces hazards and improves appearance. Our Tree Cutting & Disposal service covers routine pruning, crown reductions, shape management and safe dismantling where required. London’s urban trees often require skilled pruning to maintain clearance from buildings, reduce wind sail, or remove deadwood that could fall during storms. Our arborists apply best-practice pruning techniques to encourage healthy regrowth while preserving the tree’s natural form where desirable.</p>

							<p>All green waste and timber is handled responsibly. We use chippers for branch reduction, separate recyclable timber for reuse, and dispose of residual waste at authorised facilities in line with environmental regulations. For clients wanting to keep firewood or mulch, we can leave processed wood on site. Larger timber can be cut to size for safe transport or stored for specialist recycling projects. For any works requiring permits, protected species checks or council notifications, we provide guidance and support so projects comply with local requirements.</p>

							<p>We combine aesthetic sensibility with safety and technical expertise—our teams are DBS-checked, trained in working at height and operate with public liability insurance. Whether you require annual maintenance, pre-development pruning, or selective cutting for light management, our approach is to leave a tidy site, with clear recommendations for future maintenance and optional replanting advice tailored to local conditions across London.</p>

							<p>Contact us to arrange a site visit and receive a written quote that outlines the pruning scope, waste removal and any surface protection required. We always include clear scheduling and ensure minimal disruption to neighbours and traffic in London’s busy streets.</p>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<div class="faq-list">
					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>How much does tree removal cost in London?</h3>
						<p>Costs vary depending on tree size, location, access and complexity. For a straightforward small tree removal expect several hundred pounds; large or complex removals can run into thousands. We provide transparent, itemised quotes after a site survey. Factors affecting price include need for traffic management, crane usage, stump grinding and waste disposal.</p>
					</div>

We advise checking before work and can help identify TPOs and assist with the application process or urgent exemptions for dangerous trees.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="faq-item">
						<h3>How long does tree removal take?</h3>
						<p>Small trees can often be removed in a few hours. Larger or hazardous trees may take a day or more depending on access and safety requirements. Our quotes include realistic time estimates and we work to minimise disruption while ensuring safety and compliance.</p>
